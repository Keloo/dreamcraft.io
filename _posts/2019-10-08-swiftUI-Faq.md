## What is SwiftUI?
 SwiftUI is a revolutionary development framework that makes building powerful user interfaces easier than ever before.  Using simple, easy-to-understand declarative code, developers can create stunning, full-featured user interfaces complete with smooth animations.

## Declarative vs. Imperative UI
In declarative UI, you describe how UI should be like rather than an imperative way where you build your UI piece by piece(starting from allocating the views and adding them as subviews and ending with configuring how they look). 

## How performant SwiftUI is?
 SwiftUI apps run natively and are lightning-fast.

## Can I use UIKit, AppKit, or WatchKit with SwiftUI?
You can integrate SwiftUI views with objects from the UIKit, AppKit, and WatchKit frameworks to take further advantage of platform-specific functionality.

## Is UIKit, AppKit, or WatchKit steel actual?
Yes! Apple is still doing WWDC talks about new features in UIKit, and as mentioned before, they are interoperable.

## SwiftUI limitations
SwiftUI runs only from iOS 13, macOS 10.15, tvOS 13, and watchOS 6. So if you need lower versions, you might need UIKit, AppKit, or WatchKit.
