You have a piece of paper*, and you have no idea how to begin. A blank piece is the most intimidating place in a developing/creative environment. Once we have something, ideas tend to generate additional ideas, but before we have anything, we can choose from everything, and that might be the hardest choice.

This article doesn't have the intention to teach your a specific technology or how to design apps since the internet is full of tutorials on every topic. It intends to give you a starting point since the lack of tools and resources is no longer an excuse. Everything that you need right now is a notebook with an internet connection. Developers and Designers might be in their golden age since everything can be shared with the world as soon as it got finished. In this article, I will share a few technics that help me with starting struggle.

From "learning how to learn" course, I learned that you need to apply a small amount of wheel power at the beginning of the process to make things happen. Since it doesn't matter how you start, it only matters that you did it. Here a few strategies to start:

### Start with something that you know.

If you have previous experience, start by doing what you already did even if Albert Einstein might think that you are insane. If you have no clue about what you want to do, they're a lot of resources online that can help you with that on your Malcolm Gladwell's 10,000 Hour Rule way.


### Start with something that you saw.

How much you can take from other sources and where is the boundary between inspiration and plagiarism at the start doesn't matter. Just scrape some inspiration so you can have with what to start.

Piece of paper - might be anything from a piece of paper to an Xcode project or a sketch project.
