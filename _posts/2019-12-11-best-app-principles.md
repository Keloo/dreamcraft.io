Good things take time, and mobile apps are not an exception.  More then seven years, I am part of that industry, and I observed how good apps become best in class.
At the first look, good apps and best in class might have the same design and functionality, but under the hood, best in class apps offer way more than great apps.
This article contains a checklist that will help you with your next or existing project.

## Preparation
With every new iOS version, Apple updates its [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/), so be patient and read it every year.

## Design - KISS principle
KISS, an acronym for "keep it simple, stupid" or "keep it stupid simple," is a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
That topic is quite big, and I will not cover it here, but as always, you feel when you have a great design in front of you.

## User Experience - Don't make me think.
The app should feel native to the platform, and users should feel in the same environment as their OS. If your app is running on multiple platforms, some UX can migrate from one platform to another. So stick to the platform and don't make people think.
 
 ## Technology
With every WWDC, we get plenty of new technologies and out of the box functionality. That doesn't mean that we need to use all of them. We need to add things that may be suitable for our app. There a lot of must-have functionalities like accessibility, dark mode, dynamic fonts, and colorblind support that get ignored because of time lack. 

## Image/Video Assets and app description. - A good first impression can work wonders.
Before uploading your app to the app store, check the description, video, and images that will represent your app. Those are things that creat first impressions about your app, and you should not underestimate that critical part. Since in the beginning, the app store page may be the only thing that gets you downloads.


### Be constituent and work item by item even if most of the books recommend the fail-fast approach.
